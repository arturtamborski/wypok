Alter ego of popular site [wykop.pl](http://www.wykop.pl).

Project is made for the [Daj Się Poznać 2017](http://dajsiepoznac.pl) competition.

You can track the progress on my [blog](https://arturtamborski.pl/) tagged with [#dajsiepoznac2017](https://arturtamborski.pl/tags/dajsiepoznac2017) ([feed](https://arturtamborski.pl/tags/dajsiepoznac2017/feed)).

Testing version of this project is live at [wypok.com](https://wypok.com).
Unfortunately, the current development version offers very limited functionalities.
